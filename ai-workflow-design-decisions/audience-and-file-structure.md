# Audience and File Structure — AI Workflow Design Decisions

Covers who `ai-workflow.md` is written for, and the purpose of each section type it contains.

## Audience

The file is written for an AI coding agent.
The human does not need to read it during a task.
The human reads it when maintaining or updating the file.

The "Human is Responsible For" section is also written for the AI agent.
It tells the agent what it cannot do and must leave to the human.

## File Structure

The file is organised into six distinct section types.
Each section type has a single responsibility.

**Preamble.**
Context only.
What this file is, who it is for.
Contains no rules or principles.

**First Principles.**
The governing truths.
Keep this section as short as possible.
Every line must earn its place by being genuinely foundational.
The workflow must be model-agnostic and repo-agnostic.

**Workflow.**
The ordered sequence of steps for every task.
Each step should describe what happens and when, not how to do it in detail.
Detailed rules belong in reference sections.
The workflow points to reference sections rather than inlining their content.
Human checkpoints are explicit numbered steps.

**Reference sections.**
The detailed "how" for specific topics: planning, implementation, scope, validation, failure analysis, logging, command approval, GitHub workflow, sub-issue handling.
These do the heavy lifting.
Each reference section owns its topic.
Rules about that topic should live here, not scattered across the workflow or boundary sections.

**Boundary rules.**
Global, context-free rules that apply regardless of which step or topic is active.
Rules that don't fit into Reference sections.
Three tiers: Always Do, Ask First, Never Do.

**The Human is Responsible For.**
What the AI cannot do.
This exists so the agent knows where to stop and hand off.
