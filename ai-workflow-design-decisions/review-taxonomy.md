# Review Taxonomy — AI Workflow Design Decisions

Covers the classification system for identifying structural problems when reviewing `ai-workflow.md`.

## Cross-Contamination Categories

When reviewing the file for structural problems, classify each line as one of:

- **OK.** Line is in the right place.
- **Cross-contaminated.** Content type does not match the section's purpose (e.g. a rule in the preamble, a principle in a workflow step).
- **Redundant.** The same rule is stated in multiple places.
- **Misplaced.** The line belongs in a different specific section (e.g. a human responsibility in a workflow step).
- **Candidate to move.** The line could be offloaded to a reference section with a pointer left behind.
